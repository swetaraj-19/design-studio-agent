# Kenra Professional Brand Guidelines

[General Aesthetic]
- Images must be high-resolution, professional, and minimalist[cite: 16].
- The feel is clean, modern, and high-end[cite: 16, 33].

[Backgrounds]
- Use clean, simple, non-distracting backgrounds.
- Solid backgrounds: White, light silver-gray, or light blue are preferred[cite: 20, 22].
- Texture backgrounds: Subtle marble or light-colored tile is acceptable[cite: 37, 55].
- Do not use busy or natural outdoor settings, unless it's a specific "forest" edit.

[Lighting]
- Lighting must be soft, bright, and studio-quality[cite: 16, 33].
- Avoid harsh shadows or dark, moody lighting.
- Product labels must be clear and readable.

[Props]
- Props should be minimal and relevant to the product.
- Acceptable props include: towels [cite: 38], glass shelves [cite: 73], clean hair tools (like a blow-dryer) [cite: 31], or minimalist lab glass (beakers, flasks)[cite: 75].
- Product "texture shots" (swipes, sprays, foams) are encouraged to show the product in use[cite: 46, 57, 70, 71].

[Models]
- Model photography should look professional and polished[cite: 77].
- Hair should be the "hero," clearly showcasing the product's effect (e.g., sleek, voluminous, defined curls)[cite: 79, 84].

[Rules for Forest Backgrounds]
- This is a specific edit request.
- The forest should be natural and out-of-focus (bokeh).
- The product lighting must be adjusted to match the new background.
- Maintain a high-quality, professional look; do not make it look like a "snapshot".
