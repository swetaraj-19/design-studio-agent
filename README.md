1. Create the Virtual Environment
Open your terminal, navigate to your project's main folder, and run this command. This will create a new directory named venv (a common name) to store your project's specific Python packages.

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
(If python3 doesn't work, you might use just python on some systems, especially Windows).

2. Activate the Virtual Environment
After it's created, you must "activate" it. The command is different for macOS/Linux and Windows.

On macOS or Linux:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
On Windows (in Command Prompt):

Bash

.\venv\Scripts\activate
On Windows (in PowerShell):

Bash

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
